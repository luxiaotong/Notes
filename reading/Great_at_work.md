# Great at work

## DO LESS, THEN OBSESS

three ways you can implement the “do less, then obsess” principle: 
1. Wield the razor: Shave away unnecessary tasks, priorities, committees, steps, metrics, and procedures. Channel all your effort into excelling in the remaining activities. Ask: How many tasks can I remove, given what I must do to excel? Remember: As few as you can, as many as you must. 
2. Tie yourself to the mast: Set clear rules ahead of time to fend off temptation and distraction. Create a rule as trivial as not allowing yourself to check email for an hour. 
3. Say “no” to your boss: Explain to your boss that adding more to your to-do list will hurt your performance. The path to greatness isn’t pleasing your boss all the time. It’s saying “no” so that you can apply intense effort to excel in a few chosen areas.

## REDESIGN YOUR WORK

```markdown
The value of a person’s work = Benefits to others × quality × efficiency
```

The value equation emphasizes three distinct components. To produce great value at work is to create output that benefits others tremendously and that is done efficiently and with high quality. 

Explore five ways to redesign work to create value: 

1.  Less fluff: eliminate existing activities of little value 
2.  More right stuff: increase existing activities of high value
3.  More “Gee, whiz”: Create new activities of high value 
4.  Five star rating: improve quality of existing stuff
5.  Faster, cheaper: do existing activities more efficiently.

## DON’T JUST LEARN, LOOP

The Learning Loop is an approach to learning while you perform your daily work: you try out a new approach in a small way , then measure the outcome, then get quick feedback, then tweak your approach based on that feedback (e.g., ask the question differently).

You can deploy six tactics to implement the learning loop in your job: 

1.  Carve out just 15 
2.  Chunk it 
3.  Measure the “soft” 
4.  Get nimble feedback, fast 
5.  Dig the dip 
6.  Confront the stall point.

Effective learners break an overarching skill into micro-behaviors: they are small, concrete actions you take on a daily basis to improve a skill. The action shouldn’t take more than fifteen minutes to perform and review, and it should have a clear impact on skill development.

## P-SQUARED (PASSION AND PURPOSE)

There are three ways to expand your passions and sense of purpose: 

*   Discover a new role. You can likely find that match right where you are; you don’t have to leap to another profession. Seek a new role within your existing organization that better taps your passions and gives you a stronger sense of purpose. 
*   Expand the circle of passion. Feeling passionate about work isn’t just about taking pleasure in the work itself. Passion can also come from: success, creativity, social interactions, learning, and competence. Expand your circle of passion by tapping into these dimensions. 
*   Climb the Purpose Pyramid. Find ways to add more value (from chapter three), taking care that your contributions don’t cause harm. Second, pursue activities that are personally meaningful, no matter what others think. It helps to reframe one’s job to experience the significance it might just hold for you. Third, pursue activities that have a clear social mission.

## FORCEFUL CHAMPIONS

Forceful champions use a variety of behaviors to arouse emotions and inspire coworkers to support their efforts: 

*   They make people angry about today and excited for tomorrow. 
*   They show and don’t just tell, using striking photos and demos to evoke intense emotions. 
*   They make people feel purpose, connecting daily tedious work to a grander purpose. 
*   Forceful champions display smart grit to break down opposition and garner support for their projects: 
*   They consider the perspective of opponents (“standing in their shoes”), tailoring their tactics to address opponents’ specific concerns and agendas. 
*   They confront opponents, when needed. 
*   They make concessions they can live with to appease opponents. 
*   They co-opt opponents, so that they, too, feel a sense of ownership. 
*   They exert pressure by mobilizing people to advocate on their behalf.

## FIGHT AND UNITE

To have a productive fight in meetings, pursue the following strategies, either as leader or participant: 

*   Maximize diversity, not talent
*   Make it safe to speak up 
*   Prod the quiet to speak 
*   Show up as an advocate, not a salesperson 
*   Ask nonleading questions. 

To improve team unity, try the following: 

*   Ensure everyone has a voice (being heard creates buy-in) • Commit, especially when you utterly disagree 
*   Confront the prima donna 
*   Sharpen the team goal 
*   Stop playing office politics and get behind decisions.

## THE TWO SINS OF COLLABORATION

Organizations and employees struggle with twin sins: undercollaboration and overcollaboration. Some people talk too little across teams and departments, and some people talk too much.

To avoid the extremes of too little or too much collaboration, top performers discipline collaboration: they carefully select which collaboration activities to participate in (and reject others), and then follow specific rules to make the chosen activities a success.

Disciplined collaboration consists of the following five rules: 

1. Establish the business case—a compelling reason—for any proposed collaboration initiative, small or large. If it’s questionable, say no. 
2. Craft a unifying goal that excites people, so that they prioritize this project. 
3. Reward people for collaboration results, not activities. 
4. Commit full resources—time, skills, and money—to the collaboration. If you can’t obtain those resources, narrow its scope or kill it. 
5. Tailor trust boosters—quickly—to specific trust problems in the partnership.
